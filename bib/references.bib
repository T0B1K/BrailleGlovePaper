  abstract  = {Braille is the worldwide coding system employed to read and write by the visually impaired. However, learning Braille is a difficult task to tackle as the current didactic way of learning this language is based on memorizing numerical series associated with each letter, number or symbol. Given the difficulty that some people have with this didactic system, this paper proposes a different way of learning Braille. For this purpose, a mobile application based on tablet devices has been developed. This application is supported by a smartwatch, whose mission is to execute vibration patterns when a Braille symbol is touched on a vinyl sheet with the Braille symbols located on the tablet screen. This association, symbol + vibration pattern, is called Tacton. Hence, the aim of the proposal is to associate the Braille symbols with a Tacton instead of a numerical succession in order to make easier their learning.},

  abstract = {Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is often characterized by self-injurious behaviors, with one-half to two-third of these patients reporting hypalgesic or analgesic phenomena during self-harming. Research on pain perception in BPD suggested abnormal processing of nociception either within the sensory-discriminative and/or motivational-affective systems of pain. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether pain insensitivity could be generalized to other somatosensory submodalities. To investigate this question, 30 BPD patients and 30 matched healthy controls were enrolled in the current study and underwent a somatosensory battery composed of well-established psychophysical test assessing all the principal submodalities of somatosensation, namely pain perception (i.e., warm, cold and mechanical), discriminative touch (i.e., tactile acuity and tactile sensitivity) as well as affective touch. Results showed abnormal warm detection threshold, warm pain threshold, mechanical pain perception, and tactile sensitivity in BPD patients, but no differences emerged neither for tactile acuity nor for cold pain thresholds, cold tolerance, or for affective touch perception. Findings point to a deficit in nociception, as well as in tactile sensitivity in BPD individuals, and were discussed in relation to BPD clinical features including self-injurious behaviors.},

It transmits the relative position and distance of nearby objects as vibratory stimuli to the back of the hand and thus enables blind people to haptically explore the depth of their surrounding space, assisting with navigation tasks such as object recognition and wayfinding. The prototype requires no external hardware, is highly portable, operates in all lighting conditions, and provides continuous and immediate feedback—all while being visually unobtrusive. Both blind (n = 8) and blindfolded sighted participants (n = 6) completed structured training and obstacle courses with both the prototype and a white long cane to allow performance comparisons to be drawn between them. The subjects quickly learned how to use the glove and successfully completed all of the trials, though still being slower with it than with the cane. Qualitative interviews revealed a high level of usability and user experience. Overall, the results indicate the general processability of spatial information through sensory substitution using haptic, vibrotactile interfaces. Further research would be required to evaluate the prototype’s capabilities after extensive training and to derive a fully functional navigation aid from its features.},

An overview on this topic requires a description of the various technologies employed in building such devices, and of their application domains. This survey describes the current technology underlying haptic devices, based on the concept of “wearability level”. More than 90 devices, newly developed and described in scientific papers published in the period 2010-2021, are reviewed, which provide either haptic illusions or novel haptic feedback for teleoperation, entertainment, training, education, guidance and notification. As a result, the analyzed systems are divided into grounded, hand-held and wearable devices; the latter are further split into exoskeletons and gloves, finger-worn devices, and arm-worn devices. For the systems in each of these categories, descriptions and tables are provided that analyze their structure, including device mass and employed actuators, their applications, and other characteristics such as type of haptic feedback and tactile illusions. The paper also provides an overview of devices worn in parts of the human body other than arms and hands, and precisely haptic vests, jackets and belts, and haptic devices for head, legs and feet. Based on this analysis, the survey also provides a discussion on research gaps and challenges, and potential future directions.},

They operate at a distance, thus easier to discover; they are more hygienic and allow interaction in 3D. We validate, for the first time, in a preliminary study with sighted and a user study with blind participants, the use of mid-air haptics for conveying Braille. We tested three haptic stimulation methods, where the haptic feedback was either: a) aligned temporally, with haptic stimulation points presented simultaneously (Constant); b) not aligned temporally, presenting each point independently (Point-By-Point); or c) a combination of the previous methodologies, where feedback was presented Row-by-Row. The results show that mid-air haptics is a viable technology for presenting Braille characters, and the highest average accuracy (94\% in the preliminary and 88\% in the user study) was achieved with the Point-by-Point method.},

In previous PHL studies about teaching Morse code, we suspect that active learning processes were at least partially involved in causing extraordinarily high learning rates. Therefore we conduct a similar, 50-participant user study to investigate whether PHL is able to teach Morse code without active attention. Our study design differs from previous studies by preventing active learning explicitly (no feedback given) and implicitly (non-Morse patterns, tests prevent learning by rule of elimination) for three groups. Two other groups get the same feedback as was present in other studies. Our results show much lower learning rates when there is no active learning possible. Including active learning, we replicate the same learning results as have been reported. This suggests that our suspicion was correct and that PHL of Morse Code is possible, but greatly limited. Further studies about PHL must pay attention to whether their study design allows participants to learn actively - even small amounts of information that is actively learned may have a great impact on learning performance.},

Passive haptic learning (PHL) has already demonstrated some benefit for learning the Braille text entry system. Could this computing-enabled technique be used to improve desktop keyboard typing skills? It is unknown whether passive haptic training can improve speed on a motor task (as opposed to initial learning). We use a randomized numeric keypad to examine users’ typing performance with or without passive haptic training. When users were prevented from looking at the keyboard, the PHL group demonstrated consistent accuracy (-0.011 KSPC) while those in the control group greatly increased their error (+1.26 KSPC on average). This result is consistent with the finding that PHL users looked significantly less at the keyboard. In a second, longer study, users exposed to PHL were found to significantly improve their typing speed (mean increase of 11 WPM) versus control (mean increase of 2.2 WPM).},

The  Pantobraille,  with  a  10xl6cm  workspace,  allows  the  user  to  place  the  pointer  on  a graphical  interface,  to  perceive  forms  and  textures  using  the  sense  of  touch,  and  to  read  braille  text  on  a bi-dimensional  page.  In  order  to  determine  the  usability  of  such  a device  and  to  have  a better  understanding  of  the  issues  that  may  arise  when  manipulating  it  for  actual  interactive  tasks,  two  visually  handicapped  persons  were  asked  to  use  the  device  to  follow reading  patterns with  one  or  two  hands.  Reading  performance  and  comfort  with  the  Pantobraille  remain  inferior  to  standard  braille  displays  but  significant  improvments  were  observed  while  performing  the  complementary  pointing  and  reading  tasks  using both  hands.},

  abstract = {Blind subjects who learn to read Braille must acquire the ability to extract spatial information from subtle tactile stimuli. In order to accomplish this, neuroplastic changes appear to take place. During Braille learning, the sensorimotor cortical area devoted to the representation of the reading finger enlarges. This enlargement follows a two-step process that can be demonstrated with transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping and suggests initial unmasking of existing connections and eventual establishment of more stable structural changes. In addition, Braille learning appears to be associated with the recruitment of parts of the occipital, formerly `visual', cortex (V1 and V2) for tactile information processing. In blind, proficient Braille readers, the occipital cortex can be shown not only to be associated with tactile Braille reading but also to be critical for reading accuracy. Recent studies suggest the possibility of applying non-invasive neurophysiological techniques to guide and improve functional outcomes of these plastic changes. Such interventions might provide a means of accelerating functional adjustment to blindness.},

abstract = {Ignoring the violation of the error normality assumption is a common mistake that can cause inconsistencies in the results of the analysis of variance. To avoid this, normality tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test can be used to verify whether this assumption is met or violated. However, the test accuracy relies on a representative number of observations sampled in trials, once the calculated W statistic used for the test is considered sensitive or capable of being altered according to the sample size. Therefore, the aims of this study were to analyze the Shapiro-Wilk test response to sample size for soybean grain yield and to define the sample size for optimizing the W statistic estimate, making it more efficient and reliable. For this, the replacement sampling method was applied in trials that measured soybean grain yield per plant. The trials were performed in two locations in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and in each, three sowing dates were assessed, using a total of 30 commercial soybean cultivars. Grain yield per plant was assessed by weighing grains at maturity and correcting the value to 13 % moisture. Posteriorly, thirty-one sample scenarios were simulated per experimental unit, performing an analysis of variance and applying the Shapiro-Wilk test at 5 % error probability to the experimental unit errors in each pre-defined sampling scenario. Also, four methodologies for determining the maximum curvature point to define sample size were compared, which are the general, spline, perpendicular distance, and linear plateau methods. The 95 % confidence interval width of the W statistic had an exponential decreasing response for trials that either meet or violate the error normality assumption. Small sample sizes per experimental unit led to biased estimates of the test, where it was either under or overestimated. The perpendicular distance and linear plateau methods were the most adequate to define the sufficient sample size for the W statistic, and at least 17 plants per experimental unit should be used for estimating error normality for soybean grain yield reliably.}

abstract = {Background: In recent years, a discourse on how to systematically consider and report threats to validity started to gain momentum within the empirical software engineering community. Aims: With this study, we aim to systematically underpin the current state of threats to validity practices in software engineering research. Method: We conduct a literature review comprising 91 papers awarded with the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering. Data is extracted and analyzed by considering six main facets of threats to validity, e.g., their explicit documentation, categorization, discussion of limitations, and trade-offs. Results: Results corroborate current critiques to the threats management state of the art. Threats result to be seldom discussed in depth, and are mostly considered as an enforced afterthought rather than an active concern of the research design and execution. Conclusions: To improve the observed practice, we derived items to consider for researchers, reviewers and readers, and call for a community action to increase the understanding of knowledge creation in empirical software engineering research.},
